//  The rest of the file would go here.  This is a placeholder due to the lack of original code.
//  To complete this, you would need to provide the original code and any additional changes needed for other files.  
//  This includes updating include paths and potentially moving other files into the 'connectors' and 'interpreters' directories.

// Example of additional code that might be needed (Illustrative only):
#include "connectors/DatabaseConnector.h"
